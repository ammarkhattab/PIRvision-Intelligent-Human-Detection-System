# FogSense-Intelligent-Human-Detection-System
This project addresses reliable human detection in foggy environments where traditional vision-based systems fail. By fusing Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors with computer vision, we develop intelligent detection system that maintains high accuracy regardless of weather conditions for surveillance and autonomous applications in critical environments.
